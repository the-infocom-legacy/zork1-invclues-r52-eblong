		  <PLTABLE "How do I cross the mountains?"
			   "Play ZORK II.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I kill the songbird?"
			   "What a concept!  You need a psychiatrist."

			   "In other words, no.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I open the egg without damaging it?"
			   "You don't."
			   "Have you tried saying OPEN EGG?"
"It takes a great deal of manual dexterity and the
proper tools."
"Someone else in the game can do it."
"Only the Thief can open the egg.  Give it to him or
leave it underground where he will find it.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I fix the broken canary?"
			   "It is broken beyond repair."
			   "No one can fix it.  Really!">
		  <PLTABLE "Are the leaves useful for anything."
			   "They're great for hiding gratings."
			   "They can be taken, counted, or burned.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I open the grating?"

the presence or absence of a question on a certain
topic as an indication of what is important, and don't
assume that long answers indicate important questions.">
		  <PLTABLE "Once I have the canary in an undamaged state, what do I do with it?"
			   "Something is attracted to its singing."
			   "It is also a treasure."
			   "Try winding it in the forest.">

	 <PLTABLE "The Cellar Area"
		  <PLTABLE "Can the trapdoor be opened from below?"
			   "The ramp is too slippery to climb."
			   "Is there a way to make it less slippery?"
			   "No. You won't ever get up the ramp.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I negotiate with the Troll?"
			   "Trolls tend not to be conversational. They require a much more direct approach."
			   "You won't get past the Troll while he is conscious."

		  <PLTABLE "What do I do with the axe?"
			   "It can be used as a weapon, but isn't really necessary for anything."

		  <PLTABLE "Does the paint in the studio mean anything?"
			   "The artist was sloppy.">>
	 <PLTABLE "The Maze"
		  "How do I get through the Maze?"
		  "It is essential that you make a map of the Maze."
		  "All ten directions are used: N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW, UP and DOWN."
		  "Some passages lead back to the same room."
		  "Rooms can be marked by dropping objects. (However,
the Thief can be a pain.)"
		  "There are 22 rooms west of the Troll Room.">
	 <PLTABLE "What do I do with the rusty knife?"
		  "If you had your sword when you took it, the pulse of blinding light should have served as a warning."

		  "Let the dead rest in peace."
		  "This space intentionally left blank.">
	 <PLTABLE "Can I use the broken lantern?"
		  "If you think it's useful, there's this bridge you
might be interested in.">
	 <PLTABLE "How do I get past the Cyclops?"
		  "Fighting isn't always the answer."
		  "There are two solutions."
		  "First, the first solution:"
		  "What happens if you hang around too long, or give some-
 thing to the Cyclops?"
		  "He's hungry, isn't he?"
		  "Feed him the lunch and water."
		  "Now, the alternative solution:"
		  "Do you remember your mythology?"
		  "Take a very close look at the commandment in the black
 book."
		  "The Cyclops is scared silly of the name of his father's
nemesis, ODYSSEUS (first letter of each line in commandment -- some computer screens are narrow and make this more difficult to see)."
		  "The Latin version of the name, ULYSSES, is also accepted."
		  "For fun, try saying ODYSSEUS elsewhere.">
	 <PLTABLE "The Round Room Area"
		  <PLTABLE "How do I get the platinum bar?"
			   "There are actually two solutions."
			   "What is causing the loud roar?"
			   "Is there a way to control the flow of water?"
			   "Solve the puzzle of the dam."
			   "Does opening or closing the dam gates affect anything downstream?"
			   "Open the dam gates."
			   "Wait until the reservoir is empty, then close the gates."
			   "Take advantage of the silence in the Loud Room while the reservoir fills."
			   "Here's the alternative solution:"
			   "This solution to the Loud Room requires no object or information from elsewhere in the game."
			   "The solution has something to do with the room's acoustics."
			   "What happens when you type something ... something
... something?"
			   "Type ECHO.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I kill the rock?"
			   "How silly!"
			   "The term living rock is metaphorical, and should not be taken literally.">
		  <PLTABLE "Is there anything special about the mirror?"
			   "Breaking it is not a good idea."
			   "Looking into it can be fun."
			   "Did you ever try touching or rubbing it?"
 			   "There are two Mirror Rooms."
			   "Touching the mirror in one transports you to the other.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I enter Hades?"
			   "You must exorcise the evil spirits."
			   "For a hint, turn the page in the black book."
			   "It requires the bell, book, and candles."
			   "Ring the bell, light the candles, and read the black book."
			   "The order in which you perform the ceremony is very important."
			   "Also, you must be holding the candles when
 you light them."
			   "Speed is fo the essence, too -- don't
 waste any more time than is necessary between steps.">
		  <PLTABLE "Can I get anywhere from the Dome Room?"
			   "Yes."
			   "It is likely that you have seen the necessary
 equipment."
			   "It is found in the Attic."
			   "Tie the rope to the railing.">
		  <PLTABLE "Can I go up from the Torch Room?"
			   "No.">
		  <PLTABLE "How do I get out of the Temple area?"
			   "You'll never reach the rope."
			   "You can leave from the altar end by going down, but you haven't a prayer of getting the coffin down that hole."
			   "Or solve the puzzle of the granite walls."
			   "The altar has magical powers."
			   "What is usually done at altars?"
			   "Try praying.">
		  <PLTABLE "The Dam Area"
			   "How do I blow up the dam?"
 			   "What a concept!"
			   "This space intentionally left blank.">
		  <PLTABLE "How is the control panel operated?"
			   "You can turn the bolt."
			   "You need the wrench."
			   "You must activate the panel. (Green bubble lights up).">
		  <PLTABLE "What is the green bubble for?"
			   "It indicates that the control panel is activated."
			   "Use the buttons in the Maintenance Room.">
		  <PLTABLE "What do I do with the object which looks like a tube of toothpaste?"
			   "Read the tube."
			   "Brushing you teeth with it is not sensible."
			   "It doesn't oil the bolt well."

		  <PLTABLE "What is the screwdriver for?"
			   "You'll know when the time comes.">

			   "Try them all. You should be able to find out."

			   "The red button turns the lights on and off."
			   "The yellow button activates the control panel at the dam. (The green bubble is now glowing.)"
			   "The brown bubble deactivates the control panel.">
		  <PLTABLE "Can I stop the leak?"

			   "Isn't there some sort of glop you could apply?"
			   "Use the gunk in the tube.">
		  <PLTABLE "What is the pile of plastic good for?"
			   "What is the valve for?"
			   "Did you try blowing into it?"
			   "You need the air pump, which is north of the Reservoir."
			   "Solve the dam problem, or figure out the mirror.">>
		  <PLTABLE "Old Man River"
			   <PLTABLE "Can the river be crossed?"
				    "Not without a boat.">
			   <PLTABLE "What will placate the River God?"
				    "What have you tried to throw into the river?"
				    "There is no River God. Anything thrown in is lost forever.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I get back from across the river?"
				    "If you launch the boat from Sandy Beach, you can cross the river to the west to White Cliffs South."
				   "It is also possible to cross the rainbow.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I control the boat?"
				    "Read the label."
				    "You can say BOARD (or GET IN), DISEMBARK (or GET OUT), LAUNCH, and LAND (or a direction towards a landing area). You can also let the current carry you.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I carry a pointy object onto the boat?"
				    "Pointy objects can puncture a plastic boat. You should not carry them on. Put them in the boat before board-ing or put them into a container, such as the brown sack, first.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I go over the falls?"
				    "Just stay in the boat and wait."
				    "Well, what did you expect?"
				    "I see no intelligence here."
				    "By the way, have you ever taken a close look at the word ARAGAIN?">
			   <PLTABLE "What is the significance of the rainbow?"
				    "You can cross it and get the pot of gold."
				    "You do not click you heels together three times while saying \"There's no place like home.\""

				    "Raise or wave the sceptre while standing at the end of the rainbow.">

				    "Did you try dropping everything?">
			   <PLTABLE "What source of light can I bring into the Drafty Room?"
				    "Matches."
				    "(Well, no one said they would work in a draft.) You can't carry a light source in. There is another way."
				    "Why might the room be drafty?"
				    "Did you ever wonder where the shaft with the basket led?"
				    "Objects, including light sources, can be placed in the basket. The basket can be lowered and raised.">
			   <PLTABLE "What is the timber for?"
				    "It makes the room more interesting and the adventurer more confused.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I use the machine?"
				    "The switch description should remind you of something."
				    "Try putting something inside and turning the machine on with the screwdriver.  Have a dictionary handy."
				    "You can make a diamond out of coal.">
			   <PLTABLE "What is meant by the Granite Wall in the Slide Room?"
				    "Evidently the ancient Zorkers did not have strong truth-in-advertising laws. Take nothing for granite.">
			   <PLTABLE "Is the coal good for anything?"
				    "It is a source of carbon."
				    "One of the most valuable gems is made of carbon."
				    "Diamonds are pure carbon in a crystalline form. They are created under tremendous heat and pressure.">
			   <PLTABLE "Is the gas of any use?"
				    "It's great for blowing up dim-witted adventurers who wander into a coal mine with an open flame.">>

				    "There's no bridge.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I build a bridge?"
				    "An interesting idea..."
				    "The timber might be useful."
				    "But then again, maybe not."
				    "A valiant attempt, but this is getting you nowhere.">
			   <PLTABLE "Why doesn't the magic word plugh work in the land beyond the chasm?"
				    "A hollow voice says Fool."

				    "Whew! (That might actually be an interesting addition to the game.)">>
		  <PLTABLE "General Questions"
			   <PLTABLE "Why does the sword glow?"
				    "Elvish swords are magical, and glow with a blue light when dangers (particularly dangerous beings) are near.">
			   <PLTABLE "What do I do about the Thief?"
				    "Discretion is the better part of valor."
				    "You can almost always avoid a confrontation by walking away. Although you may be robbed, at least you won't be killed.">
			   <PLTABLE "How may points are there in the game?"
				    "350. Any time you say QUIT, RESTART, or SCORE, this is pointed out.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I get out of the dungeons?"
				    "There are six exits."
				    "The chimney will allow you to carry one object at a time in addition to your lamp."
				    "Once you find an exit other than the chimney, the trap door will not close behind you."
				    "Probably the easiest exit (conceptually) is by way of the grating. You will probably come across the other three exits while solving some of the harder problems, but it is not necessary to find more than one to complete the game.">
			   <PLTABLE "What is the significance of all the engravings?"
				    "The knowledgeable critic, I.Q. Roundhead, wrote a ten-volume study of the engravings of the ancient Zorkers. To make a long story short, he concluded that the Zorkers were very strange people.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I kill the Thief?"
				    "The Thief is a cunning and dangerous opponent, skilled in the martial arts. Novice Zorkers would do well to avoid him."
				    "It is possible to distract him for one move by giving him something of value."
				    "The nasty knife is a marginally more effective weapon to use against him."
				    "As you gain in points, you become a better match.">
			   <PLTABLE "How can I recharge my lamp?"
				    "What makes you think you can?"
				    "It is always best to conserve resources. You can prolong its life by turning it off whenever you can and using alternate light sources.">
			   <PLTABLE "What happens when you die in ZORK I?"
				    "You may appear in the forest with your belongings scattered (valuables below ground, nonvaluables above)."
				    "You may wander as a spirit until you find a way to resurrect yourself."
				    "ZORK I is as fair as baseball. Three strikes and your out."
				    "You become a spirit if you have visited a certain location before death."
				    "The location is the altar in the South Temple."
				    "Try praying at the altar.">
			   <PLTABLE "Who is the Other Occupant?"
				    "He of the large bag."
				    "The Thief, of course.">
			   <PLTABLE "How do I go over the falls without killing myself?"
				    "Why not ask, How do I cut off my head without killing myself?">
			   <PLTABLE "Where is HELLO SAILOR useful?"
				    "Are you sure you want to know?"
				    "Absolutely certain?"
				    "To quote the black book, Oh ye who go about saying unto each: 'Hello Sailor': Dost thou know the magnitude of thy sin before the gods? ... Surely thou shalt repent of thy cunning."
				    "Nowhere. (You were warned.)">
			   <PLTABLE "Why do things move and disappear in the dungeon?"
				    "The Thief is constantly moving about."
				    "There is a high probability that he will take valuable objects (except the gold coffin) which you have seen. There is a much lower probability that he will take a nonvaluable object (again, only if you have seen it), and he may later decide to drop it.">
			   <PLTABLE "Where are the treasures the Thief took from me?"
				    "As he wanders about stealing things, he puts them in his bag. Whenever he stops in his Treasure Room, he drops off the valuables he has collected."
				    "You can get the contents of the bag by defeating him in a fight."
				    "The Treasure Room is guarded by the Cyclops.">
			   <PLTABLE "What do I do with the stiletto?"
				    "Congratulations! Getting the stiletto is rare. If you keep it away from the Thief, he won't attack you."
				    "It is a weapon, nothing more.">
			   <PLTABLE "Who is the lean and hungry gentleman?"
				    "The Thief.">
			   <PLTABLE "Where can I use the shovel?"
				    "It will dig only into very soft soil."
				    "Try it in the sand."
				    "The sand in the Sandy Cove is most promising.">
			   <PLTABLE "Is there any significance to all the granite walls?"
				    "There are only two true granite walls."
				    "While next to a real granite wall, you can transport yourself to the location of the other by saying the name of the room."
				    "The two granite walls ar in the Temple and the Treasure Room.">

				    "You'll know when the time comes."
				    "When you have all 350 points, you'll be able to enter the Barrow.">
			   <PLTABLE "How Points are Scored."
				    "(Use only as a last resort.)"
				    "You get 10 points for getting into the house, 25 for getting into the Cellar, 5 for getting past the Troll, 13 for getting to the Drafty Room, and 25 for getting to the Treasure Room."
				    "These points plus all the treasure points make 350. When you have all 350 points, the twentieth treasure will appear in the case -- a map which leads (indirectly) to 400 more points (ZORK II).">
